# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Student Quiz System is a fast-paced math quiz application where students solve multiple-choice questions within time constraints. The system tracks individual performance, provides scoring, and shows student rankings compared to peers. Students progress through different difficulty levels and lessons organized by weeks, with access controls for advanced levels.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a student, I want to view available lessons organized by difficulty levels, so that I can choose appropriate content for my skill level.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student navigates to "/student/level" THEN the system SHALL display a list of lessons organized by week numbers
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL show tabs for different levels (Beginner, Movers, etc.)
3. WHEN a student is on Beginner level THEN the system SHALL allow access to all lessons without restrictions
4. WHEN a student selects any level other than Beginner THEN the system SHALL show locked lessons with "Request Access" buttons
5. IF a student clicks "Request Access" THEN the system SHALL send an access request to the admin for that level

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a student, I want to select quiz difficulty and timing, so that I can challenge myself appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student clicks on an available lesson THEN the system SHALL display a modal with difficulty choices
2. WHEN the modal opens THEN the system SHALL show three difficulty options: Easy (15 seconds), Medium (10 seconds), Hard (5 seconds)
3. WHEN a student selects a difficulty THEN the system SHALL proceed to generate a quiz with the corresponding time limit
4. IF a student closes the modal without selecting THEN the system SHALL return to the lesson list

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a student, I want to take timed math quizzes with multiple choice questions, so that I can practice and improve my math skills quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quiz starts THEN the system SHALL select all questions from the chosen week and level
2. WHEN each question is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the math problem with 4 multiple choice options (A, B, C, D)
3. WHEN a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL start a countdown timer based on selected difficulty
4. WHEN the timer reaches zero THEN the system SHALL automatically move to the next question marking the current as incorrect
5. WHEN a student selects an answer THEN the system SHALL immediately move to the next question
6. WHEN all questions are completed or time expires THEN the system SHALL proceed to the results screen

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see my quiz results and ranking, so that I can track my progress and compare with other students.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quiz is completed THEN the system SHALL calculate and display the student's score
2. WHEN the results screen loads THEN the system SHALL show the number of correct answers out of total questions
3. WHEN results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show the student's placement/ranking compared to other students who took the same quiz
4. WHEN results are shown THEN the system SHALL store the performance data for future reference
5. IF multiple students have the same score THEN the system SHALL handle tie-breaking consistently

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to manage student access to different difficulty levels, so that I can control progression and maintain appropriate challenge levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student requests access to a locked level THEN the system SHALL notify the administrator
2. WHEN an administrator reviews access requests THEN the system SHALL provide options to approve or deny access
3. WHEN access is granted THEN the system SHALL unlock the requested level for that specific student
4. WHEN access is denied THEN the system SHALL maintain the locked state and optionally notify the student

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a student, I want my performance to be tracked across sessions, so that I can see my improvement over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student completes a quiz THEN the system SHALL store their score, time taken, and accuracy in the database
2. WHEN a student logs in THEN the system SHALL retrieve their historical performance data
3. WHEN performance data is stored THEN the system SHALL associate it with the correct student, level, week, and difficulty
4. WHEN calculating rankings THEN the system SHALL use the most recent or best performance for each student per quiz type

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a student, I want the quiz interface to be responsive and intuitive, so that I can focus on solving problems quickly without interface confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a question is displayed THEN the system SHALL show a clear, readable math problem
2. WHEN answer options are shown THEN the system SHALL display them as clearly labeled buttons (A, B, C, D)
3. WHEN the timer is running THEN the system SHALL show a visible countdown indicator that works correctly
4. WHEN a student selects an answer THEN the system SHALL immediately show the correct answer and move to the next question without delay
5. WHEN transitioning between questions THEN the system SHALL have no loading delays or transition animations

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a student, I want a lives system that tracks my mistakes, so that I have limited chances and feel more engaged with the quiz challenge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a quiz starts THEN the system SHALL give the student 3 lives
2. WHEN a student answers a question incorrectly THEN the system SHALL remove one life
3. WHEN a student runs out of time on a question THEN the system SHALL remove one life
4. WHEN a student has 0 lives remaining THEN the system SHALL end the quiz immediately
5. WHEN the lives counter is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current number of lives remaining
6. WHEN a student answers correctly THEN the system SHALL NOT remove any lives

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a student, I want to see the correct answer immediately after making my selection, so that I can learn from my mistakes in real-time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a student selects an answer THEN the system SHALL immediately highlight the correct answer
2. WHEN the correct answer is shown THEN the system SHALL indicate whether the student's choice was right or wrong
3. WHEN displaying the answer feedback THEN the system SHALL show this for a brief moment before moving to the next question
